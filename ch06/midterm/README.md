# CS110 Midterm Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(This is a wonderful drawing of steve from minecraft. He adorns a pumpkin mask and is enjoying life.)*

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(So the only known bug that I cannot fix for the life of me is with his right arm. The left arm is outlined in black, but the right arm has no outline and I was unable to find a way to fix it.)*

## REFERENCES *(I used the turtle documentation, and a color pallet to match steves colors from the game.)*

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(I did a lot of editing to lower the code length. I did this by adding for loops for the rectangles so it wouldn't take up as many lines. Other than that I don't think there was any way I could've made this shorter, but I could be wrong.)*
